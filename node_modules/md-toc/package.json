  "readme": "# Table of Contents Generator\n\n## About\n\nSay you've got a README.md file with lots of information, and you want to\ncreate a table of contents with reference links\n\nThis script will help you to do so. It extracts information of titles\nin a given file and inserts a formatted table of contents in the position,\nspecified by `@@TOC@@` line.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nThe table of contents for the README.md was generated with\nthis utility, so you can treat it as a demo\n\n- [Table of Contents Generator](#table-of-contents-generator)\n    - [About](#about)\n    - [Installation](#installation)\n    - [Usage](#usage)\n    - [Example](#example)\n    - [Limitations](#limitations)\n\n## Installation\n\nEasy with npm\n```\nnpm install -g md-toc-filter\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, make sure you've got `@@TOC@@` token on a separate\nline in your markdown-file. This is the place the table of contents\nwill be inserted to.\n\nThen, preprocess the file:\n```\nmd-toc-filter README.md > NEW_README.md\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```\n# Foo Great Project\n\nHey, this is my project\n\n## Contents\n@@TOC@@\n\n## About\n\nSome info about it\n\n## Authors\n\nMy picture here\n```\n\nWill be transformed to\n```\n# Foo Great Project\n\nHey, this is my project\n\n## Contents\n- [Foo Great Project](#foo-great-project)\n    - [Contents](#contents)\n    - [About](#about)\n    - [Authors](#authors)\n\n## About\n\nSome info about it\n\n## Authors\n\nMy picture here\n```\n\nAfter the preprocessing you're free to modify the result as you wish.\nFor example, it makes sense to remove reference to table of contents from\ntable of contents\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe script doesn't support underlined titles like this\n```\nMy Title\n========\n```\n\nUse sharps instead\n```\n# My Title\n```\n",
